# Packet-Sniffing-Lab
This project demonstrates the use of tcpdump to capture and analyze network traffic on a virtual lab setup.

## Objectives
- Configure a virtual network of three Ubuntu VMs (Client, Server, Attacker)
- Use tcpdump to:
  - Capture all traffic to/from the client
  - Capture traffic initiated by the client
  - Capture traffic destined to the server
  - Capture ICMP traffic between client and server
  - Save captured traffic to a file for later analysis

## Tools Used
- Ubuntu Linux
- tcpdump
- Wireshark (for verifying saved captures)

## Skills Demonstrated
- Virtual machine networking
- Packet sniffing with tcpdump
- Filtering traffic by host, source, and protocol
- Capturing and saving ICMP traffic
- Basic analysis of network communication

## Report
The full lab report with screenshots and evidence is included in a different folder.
